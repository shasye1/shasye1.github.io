### About Me
I’m a Master's student studying Computer Science at DePaul University, with a specialization in Data Science and a graduate from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), with a Bachelor's in Molecular and Cellular Biology. I invest time outside of classes learning about new CS topics and applications in the Machine Learning and Data Science field through personal projects/competitions. I've had intern experience with the manufacturing and finance industry, as well as academic experience in healthcare/life sciences and computer science.
