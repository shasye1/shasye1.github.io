## Projects

*   &#128147; [Predicting Heart Disease](https://www.shahbazsyed.com/heartdisease): Copy from a presentation and demo I gave to new students who wanted to learn more about Python and Data Science. The link features a notebook going through some exploratory data analysis and some machine learning techniques such as decision trees, random forest classifiers, grid search, etc.

*   &#127780; [Temperature Competition](https://www.shahbazsyed.com/temp): Competition to predict temperature for the next 24 hours. Utilized Keras and Tensorflow to create an LSTM neural network for predicting each hour of temperature based on the previous 24 hours of temperature.

*   &#128184; [Black Friday Competition](https://www.shahbazsyed.com/Black_Friday) by Analytics Vidhya: Data Analysis of Black Friday sales and customer data utilizing customer demographics to predict the purchase amount of customers against various product categories.

*   &#128110; [Crimes In Chicago](https://www.shahbazsyed.com/crimes) by the Chicago Data Portal: A data visualization of crimes that took place in the City of Chicago from 2017 to 2018. There are a number of filters in which you can compare the types of crimes and their relative locations to one another and your favorite spots around the Chicago area.

*   &#128679; [Potholes In Chicago](https://www.shahbazsyed.com/potholes) by the Chicago Data Portal: A data visualization featuring the recorded potholes reported via the 311 Chicago call center since 2011. The filter on the right allows you to see points at which potholes existed and whether they were actually completed in the specified date the pothole report was created, or whether they weren't.
