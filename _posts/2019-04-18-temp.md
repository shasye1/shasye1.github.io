title: Temperature Predicting with LSTMs
tags: [python, pandas, numpy, Tensorflow, Keras, LSTMs, data-analysis]

This data analysis comes from a competition/hackathon I was in to predict temperature for the next 24 hours. I used Keras and Tensorflow to create an LSTM neural network for predicting each hour of temperature based on the previous 24 hours of temperature. The dataset features some variables regarding weather and other atmospheric measurements. All the code can be seen [here](https://www.shahbazsyed.com/temp), or under the projects section above.
