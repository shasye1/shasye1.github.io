These data visualizations are based off data from the City of Chicago. The Chicago Data Portal releases updated datasets featuring various statistics about our city ranging from public safety to education. In [this](https://www.shahbazsyed.com/crimes) interactive visualization I created through tableau, you can filter different fields such as the type of incident/crime that occurred, as well as the time, place, etc. and [here](https://www.shahbazsyed.com/potholes) is something similar in regards to the potholes around Chicago. Check them out!
