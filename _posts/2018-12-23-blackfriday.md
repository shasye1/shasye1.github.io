This data analysis comes from a competition sponsored by Analytics Vidhya, the dataset featuring customer demographics and product categories, which are to be used to get a prediction on purchase price. Most of the variables are masked and are represented to be simply categorical, which make the dataset itself less interesting. The analysis itself was mainly used to practice my usage with python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn, as well as visualizations with plotly seaborn. All the code can be seen [here](https://www.shahbazsyed.com/Black_Friday), or under the projects section above.
