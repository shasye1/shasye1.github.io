This data visualization is based off data from the City of Chicago. The Chicago Data Portal releases updated datasets featuring various statistics about our city ranging from public safety to education. In this interactive visualization I created through tableau, you can filter different fields such as the type of incident that occurred, as well as the time, place, etc.
