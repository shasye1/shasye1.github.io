This data analysis comes from a presentation I did for Students Interested in Data Science (SiDS), a program I made for people within my hometown interested in data science. The dataset features anonymized patient health demographics, which were used to get a prediction of whether or not they had heart disease. The variables were cleaned and narrowed down to 14 which are: age, sex, chest pain, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, max heart rate achieved, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major blood vessels, status of major vessels (Normal, fixed, defective), exercise induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, and the diagnosis of the heart disease. All the code can be seen [here](https://www.shahbazsyed.com/heartdisease), or under the projects section above.
